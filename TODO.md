# Project Refactoring and Migration Log

This document outlines the process of refactoring the `control_theory_notes.tex` document to make it modular and fix compilation errors.

## 1. The Initial Problem

The project started as a single, large LaTeX file (`control_theory_notes.tex`) that was difficult to manage and failed to compile with `lualatex`. The compilation produced a cascade of errors, making it difficult to identify the root cause.

## 2. The Goal

The objective was to:
- Restructure the project into a modular, hierarchical format.
- Fix all compilation errors.
- Establish a stable workflow for future additions.

## 3. First Attempt: What Went Wrong

Our initial attempt involved splitting the document and trying to fix all the errors at once. This was not effective.

- **Misleading Errors:** The `lualatex` errors pointed to syntax issues within `align` environments and `tikzpicture` plots.
- **Incorrect Fixes:** We spent several cycles trying to fix the syntax of these environments (e.g., changing `\addplot table` to `\addplot coordinates`, adjusting backslashes), but the errors persisted.
- **Root Cause:** The actual problem was not the syntax of the plots, but a **package conflict**. The `bodeplot` package was loaded in the preamble but not used, and it was silently conflicting with the `pgfplots` and `tikz` packages that were being used to draw the plots manually.

## 4. Successful Methodology: Incremental Migration

We reset the changes and adopted a more careful, piece-by-piece methodology which proved successful.

- **Step 1: Establish a Solid Foundation**
  - The original file was renamed to `control_theory_notes.original.tex` for backup.
  - A new, clean master file (`control_theory_notes.tex`) was created with a minimal preamble.
  - **Crucially, the conflicting `bodeplot` package was removed from the preamble.**
  - This empty master file was compiled to ensure the base was stable.

- **Step 2: Create a Hierarchical Structure**
  - Directories `classical/` and `modern/` were created to organize the content according to the parts of the document.

- **Step 3: Migrate and Verify, Section by Section**
  - Each `\section` from the original document was moved into its own file within the appropriate directory (e.g., `classical/01-general-concepts.tex`).
  - After creating each new file, an `\input{}` command was added to the master file, and the **document was recompiled immediately**.

- **Step 4: Isolate and Fix Errors**
  - This incremental process allowed us to pinpoint errors with precision. When a compilation failed, we knew the error was in the last section added.
  - **Encoding Errors:** We found and fixed several "Invalid character" errors by rewriting the content of the problematic files to remove hidden characters.
  - **Typo:** We found and fixed an `\ts` typo, changing it to `t_s`.
  - **Plotting Errors:** The `tikzpicture` errors from the first attempt did not reappear after removing the `bodeplot` package and correcting the plot syntax, confirming the package conflict as the root cause.

## 5. Current Status

**Migration Complete!**

The entire document, including all sections from both "Classical Control Theory" and "Modern Control Theory", has been successfully migrated to the new modular structure. The project is stable and compiles without errors using `lualatex`.

## 6. TODO

- [x] **Continue Migration:** Migrate the remaining sections of "Modern Control Theory" from `control_theory_notes.original.tex` into the `modern/` directory, following the one-section-at-a-time methodology.
- [ ] **Git Commit:** Commit the new file structure to your git repository to save the stable state.
- [ ] **(Optional) Re-evaluate `bodeplot`:** If the features of the `bodeplot` package are desired, it can be re-introduced. If conflicts reappear, the solution would be to use the commands provided by `bodeplot` to generate the plots, rather than drawing them manually with `tikz`.
